# CrossfadePlayer

### Functionality

Simple implementation of mediaplayer. Simply add 2 tracks to play them after each other with beautiful crossfade effect.
You can change crossfade time from 2 to 10 seconds. We have track length restrictions. Any media should be twice longer than crossfade time.

### UI

We have 2 buttons for track uploading. Seekbar for crossfade time changing and play button.
Player has infinite loop, so uploaded tracks will play after each other.

### Installion

Just use the app-debug.apk from this repo to install this app. Or build it with latest version of Kotlin and Gradle and launch it in emulator.
